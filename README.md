An open source, github super diff screen-shotting machine.

Developed and tested on a Mac.  
Pull-requests and feature-requests are welcomed.  

##It uses the Github image diff tool

##And Saucelab's giant data center of browsers

##Follow the FORK, CONFIG, SHOOT instructions below to get up and running!

#FORK
Hit the little fork button in the top right.  Then clone the fork to your computer

#CONFIG

Install the components

``` bundle install ```

Go to www.saucelabs.com and sign up for a account and find your grid url

A easy way to find your saucelabs url is to go here: https://saucelabs.com/docs/ondemand/getting-started/env/ruby/se2/mac


Create a ``` config.yaml ``` file in the root directory
add the below two lines to it

```
grid: "http://ursaucelabsurl@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub"
maxthreads: 3
```

-don't worry the ``` config.yaml ``` file is in the .gitignore and won't be checked in.

-make the maxthreads 1 more than you have in your saucelabs account.  This makes sure one is on standby and the others do not time out.  The free saucelabs account comes with 2 threads so start with 3!

Edit the ``` browsers.yaml``` file

Any browser/os combo saucelabs can handle is fair game!

Example:
```
- !ruby/object:Browser 
  name: 'firefox'
  version: '25'
  platform: 'Windows 8'
  resolution: '1280x1024'
```

#SHOOT

Pick a url run the below command and yell SHOTS!!
```
./sos -u http://www.cnn.com
```

Browse in github to your forked repository and view the ``` /commits/  ``` section and checkout your latest commit and screen shots!

* base browser - enabling browser vs browser comparison

* complex branching - enabling sophisticated date comparisons
